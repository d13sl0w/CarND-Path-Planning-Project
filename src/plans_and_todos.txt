1.first pass idea, just go in straight line along highway, using Frenet coordinates
    * find a car in front of you, slow, follow that car?
    * what if no car in front of you?
    * what if car changes lanes?
    * how to reliably smooth path?






Broad To-Dos:
-Frenet coordinates speed calculator
-FSM for decision making probably?
-auto restart for running algorithm over again?
-logging crashes? PROBABLY NOT
-trajectory generation mechanism for sure
-waypt interpolation for more comprehensible short term geometries
-current lane analyzer (w/ or w/o waypt modifier)
-spline together old and new portions

-some sort of RL thing like from MITSDC
